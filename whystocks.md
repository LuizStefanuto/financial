# Why stocks

## 

Market participants may have a number of different reasons in which their actions are based. Fundamentally, these reasons can be classified in two main groups, namely price speculation and income ownership. Price speculation refers to the difference between the purchased price and the price at which the asset is sold. Therefore, virtually any asset can be the subject of price speculation and a position can be initiated either by buying or selling. In this context, different types of arbitrage may be considered a special case of price speculation. Another less intuitive example perhaps is the purchase of insurance, through financial derivatives or put options. Income ownership is the negotiation of an asset with the goal of trading the income it generates. Obvioulsy, only assets that generate some form of income are subject to this type of action. An income ownership position can be initiated via a buying operation, when the purpose is receiving the asset's income, or a selling operation, when the purpose is to sell income.
